			<h3>I'm a web developer, and I love making really, really good websites and applications.</h3>
			<p>Good web design is more than just looking pretty, and it's more than flawless code.
			Both elements are critical in today's world of powerful internet applications. Combine them with an intuitive interface that draws users in
			and you'll have an engaging experience that draws users in and keeps them smiling.</p>

				<p><span class="bigQuote">"</span>The Quantile team at MetaMetrics just made our final Round 1 Delivery to a major client last week... The CMS has greatly improved our efficiency and productivity. Also, we feel that your attention
				to our needs, fixing the bugs as time permitted, and general support has made a huge difference in our ability to be successful

			<p>I work closely with my clients from brainstorming to the final keystroke to make sure the design is exactly what they want,
			and I'm great at translating their needs into a user-friendly experience. At the end of the day, I deliver beautiful,
			rock-solid apps that are fun and easy to use.</p>
			<p>With a mastery of JavaScript, HTML/HTML5, CSS, and leveraging a slew of modern frameworks and technologies like Angular and Knockout,
			I'm ready to help you build sopohistocated web apps with stylish designs and great user experiences.
			While my sweet spot is front-end development, I've got strong Python skills and plenty of experience using frameworks like Django
			to build apps driven from server-side code.</p>
			<p>Come take a look at my portfolio and history, then get in touch with me for more information about what I can build for you.</p>
